# Orbit-v1
**Orbit V1 is the first version of an Orbit designed to perform full automation through voice commands. Instead of clicking menus or typing long instructions, a user can simply speak one command and Orbit V1 will interpret that command and execute the requested task automatically.**

1. Voice Command Feature – Orbit

- Control Your Computer Using Your Voice

The Voice Command feature in Orbit allows users to control their computer using natural language voice commands.
No clicking. No typing. Just speak your intent and let Orbit do the work.

🚀 What Is Voice Command?

Voice Command enables hands-free system interaction by converting spoken language into intelligent system actions.
It is designed to:
1)Reduce manual effort
2)Increase productivity
3)Make system control faster and more intuitive

✨ Features

1)Open, close, and switch applications
2)Create, rename, move, and delete files or folders
3)Search files, applications, and system settings
4)Open websites using voice
5)Execute multi-step commands in a single sentence

Example command:

- Move all PDF files from Downloads to Documents
- Open Visual Studio Code
- Create a folder named AIOS in Documents
- Move all images from Desktop to Pictures
- Close all applications except browser
- Search for invoice files from last week

🧠 How It Works

1. User speaks a voice command
2. Orbit converts speech to text
3. AI processes intent and context
4. System executes the action
5. User receives confirmation
6. No scripting or technical setup required.

🗣️ Natural Language Support

Orbit understands how humans naturally speak.

You can say:

“Open Chrome”
“Create a folder named Projects on Desktop”
“Close all background applications”

Commands do not need strict syntax.

🔐 Privacy & Security

User trust is a core principle of Orbit.

- Microphone (only when voice command is enabled)
- System controls explicitly approved by the user
